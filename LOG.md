## 2026-11-10 — M0: repo + environment
- Created `~/nanoserve`, git init, uv project (Python 3.11), torch from PyTorch cu130 index.
- Found: WSL default distro is `docker-desktop` (must use `wsl -d Ubuntu`); WSL RAM cap 11 GB; no nvcc.
- Env check: torch 2.14.1+cu130, triton 3.8.0, transformers 5.22.2. RTX 3050 cap (8,6), bf16 OK,
  5.03 GiB VRAM free. bf16 matmul OK; Triton vector-add max err 0.0.
- FAILED: HF backend hung on the 2nd test: its batcher task was bound to the first event loop
  (pytest-asyncio uses a new loop per test). Fix: restart the batcher when called from a new loop.
- FAILED: vLLM install died mid-download: C: hit 0 MB free (the WSL disk lived on C:), and WSL started
  throwing I/O errors. Fix: `wsl --manage Ubuntu --move D:\WSL\Ubuntu`. Tests afterwards: 19 pass,
  4 fail (only the unimplemented percentile) -- same as before the move, so no corruption.
